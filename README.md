# WEATHER-CONDITIONS-AND-CLIMATE-CHANGE-WITH-CLIMATEWINS-PART-2
Categorizing and predicting the weather in mainland Europe with the use of Machine Learning
## Project Background
ClimateWins wants to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years. 

However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. 

ClimateWins has a few areas it wants to cover: 
● Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years. 
● Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe. 
● Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing. 
● Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based on current trends. 
● Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years. 

## Data
Our data set is based on weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe, which contain data ranging from the late 1800s to 2022. Recordings exist for almost every day with values such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more. This data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project.
